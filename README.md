1. Files (urls & words) will have values provided line by line. If a line is empty, it is ignored.
2. Values are matched regardless of their case. For example: "CAT" and "cat" are matched as same.
3. If duplicates urls/words are provided in the files, only one occurrence of the value is considered.
4. The content is split on all non-alphanumeric characters.

Approach:
